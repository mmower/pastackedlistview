# PAStackedListView
by Tomas Franz√©n

## Introduction

This is a Cocoa NSView subclass that displays a stacked list of boxes that can be expanded and collapsed using disclosure triangles. PAStackedListView manages animations of boxes opening
and closing. This makes the control ideal for building interfaces such as an inspector where it is not desirable that all information be visible at the same time.
